# Symmetric norming functions on sequences

A **symmetric norming function** in the sense of Gohberg–Kreĭn: a subadditive,
positively homogeneous, permutation-invariant, monotone, normalized gauge on
finitely supported nonnegative sequences, together with its extension to
arbitrary `ℝ≥0∞`-valued sequences.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.TruncationGauge` — the structure.
* `TauCeti.TruncationGauge.extend` — the extension to `ℕ → ℝ≥0∞`, as a supremum
  over finitely supported truncations.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.TruncationGauge.single` — the gauge of a basis vector is its value;
  this is what `normalized'` and `symm'` buy together, and everything needing a
  scale goes through it.
* `TauCeti.TruncationGauge.extend_mono` and `extend_smul` — monotone in the
  sequence, and homogeneous under a nonnegative real scalar.
* `TauCeti.TruncationGauge.iSup_le_extend_le_tsum` — the two ends of the scale,
  `‖a‖_∞ ≤ Φ∞ a ≤ ∑ aₙ`, which is where `normalized` earns its place.

## Design

This is the `ℕ`-indexed, `ℝ≥0`-valued counterpart of
`TauCeti.FiniteSymmetricGauge` in `ForTauCeti/Analysis/Convex/Majorization.lean`,
and it mirrors that structure field for field where the two agree. The
differences are forced rather than chosen: values are `ℝ≥0`, so the finite
version's `real_smul'` with its `|c|` becomes plain multiplication and
`neg_single'` disappears; and `mono` and `normalized` are added, both of which
are vacuous or meaningless at a fixed finite index type.

**`extend` is a supremum, not a `tsum`.** The gauge has to be total and genuinely
`∞` off its ideal, and a supremum of an increasing net is total by construction,
where any route through summability reintroduces the side conditions this
interface exists to avoid. The same choice is what lets `schattenENorm` live at
`ℝ≥0∞` without side conditions.

**The supremum is over `Finset.range k` truncations rather than over all finitely
supported minorants.** Those give the same value — `mono` plus `symm` is exactly
what makes a truncation of the decreasing rearrangement extremal among minorants
of the same support size — but the `range k` form is a *monotone* net indexed by
`ℕ`, which is what a limit argument can use. Nothing in this file needs that
equivalence, and the family construction that does should prove it rather than
inherit it as a definition.

## A correction worth keeping

An earlier version of this docstring recorded `extend_smul` as blocked, saying
Mathlib "does not appear to state directly" that `min` commutes with
multiplication in `ℝ≥0∞`. **It does: `mul_min`.** The failing attempt had used
`ENNReal.mul_min_eq_min_mul`, which does not exist, and a single wrong guess at a
name became a recorded claim that the *fact* was absent. **Searching for a name
is not searching for a fact**, and the negative result sat in a
submission-library docstring where the next reader would have believed it.

## Not proved here, deliberately

`extend_coe_finsupp` — that `extend` restricted to a finitely supported sequence
is the gauge itself — is **not** in this file. It is true and it is the obvious
next lemma, but it needs the extremality of `range k` truncations noted above,
which is the same fact `symmetricGaugeFamily` needs. Proving it twice, or proving
it here and having the family slice restate it, is how one fact ends up with two
names. It belongs to the second slice of `{lane:FTC-SYMGAUGE}`.

stylistic choice: `ENNReal.toNNReal ∞ = 0`, so `min (a n).toNNReal m` reads an
infinite entry as *zero* and is not monotone in `a`.  Capping first sends `∞` to
`m`, and the supremum over `m` then recovers `∞` as the supremum of the finite

`extend` is defined as a supremum over the two-parameter family `truncate a k m`.  This
says the restriction to that family costs nothing: the same value is obtained by ranging
over every `b : ℕ →₀ ℝ≥0` dominated by `a`.

**Recorded because `ForTauCeti` currently contains a second `TruncationGauge` whose `extend`
is defined by the right-hand side here** (`Analysis/Normed/TruncationGauge.lean`), and
reconciling the two is a proof obligation, not a renaming — the two definitions are
different constructions that happen to agree.  This is that obligation, discharged on the
side that can state it.  See `{lane:FTC-SYMGAUGE-COLLIDE}`.

Both directions are short and neither needs more than `Φ.mono`: every truncation is
dominated, and conversely a dominated `b` has finite support, so it sits below the
truncation at any length past its support and any cap above its values. -/

/-! ### The `ℓᵖ` symmetric norming function

`schattenGauge p` is the sequence-indexed counterpart of
`TauCeti.lpSymmetricGauge` in `ForTauCeti/Analysis/Normed/FiniteLpGauge.lean`,
which is the `Fin n` version.  Neither replaces the other; they are related by
`toFinite`.

**Why it is here rather than beside the finite one:** with it,
`symmetricGaugeFamily (schattenGauge p hp)` is the Schatten-`p` ideal and all
five ideal laws come free — which is the roadmap's own framing, that the Schatten
classes are *obtained* from Milestone B1 rather than constructed.

/-! ### Restriction to `Fin n`

The bridge to `TauCeti.FiniteSymmetricGauge`, which is what lets the finite
Hardy–Littlewood–Pólya transfer `FiniteSymmetricGauge.le_of_prefixSum_le` reach
sequences.  **The transfer itself is not reproved here** — it exists complete in
`ForTauCeti/Analysis/Convex/Majorization.lean`; only the restriction was missing,
and it is Milestone B2's blocker rather than the majorization argument.

**Absolute values are what reconcile the two structures**, and they are not a
convenience.  `FiniteSymmetricGauge` is `ℝ`-valued with a `neg_single'` field and
an `|c|` in its homogeneity; `TruncationGauge` is `ℝ≥0`-valued with neither.
Taking `|·|` on the way in is what discharges both, and it is why `add_le'` needs
`mono'` on top of `add_le'` rather than `add_le'` alone.

/-! ### The gauge a symmetric norming function induces on operators

`symmetricGaugeENorm Φ A = Φ∞ (a(A))`, the symmetric gauge read along the
approximation numbers.  This is `symmetricGaugeFamily`'s gauge, and the three
laws below are three of the five `OperatorIdealFamily` fields.

**`gauge_add_le` is not here**, and the structure is therefore not assembled: a
`SymmetricOperatorIdealFamily` with four of five fields is not a thing that can
exist, and an undischarged placeholder would fail `check_tauceti_readiness`.

**Its route is settled, and it is `Family/Schatten.lean`'s, generalised.**  That
module solves the identical problem for the `ℓᵖ` gauge in
`lpGauge_approximationNumber_add_le`, whose docstring states the argument: the
truncated sequences are *weakly majorized* — antitone and nonnegative because
approximation numbers are, prefix-comparable because that comparison **is**
`kyFanGauge_add_le` — so a monotone-under-weak-majorization lemma applies.

Every ingredient for the general case now exists:

* `kyFanApproximationGauge_add_le_of_minMax` gives
  `∑_{i<k} aᵢ(S+T) ≤ ∑_{i<k} aᵢ(S) + ∑_{i<k} aᵢ(T)`, so `a(S+T)` is weakly
  majorized by the **pointwise sum** `a(S) + a(T)`;
* `FiniteSymmetricGauge.mono_weaklyMajorized` (`Analysis/Convex/Majorization.lean`)
  turns that into a gauge inequality, at `Φ.toFinite k` — which is what the
  bridge above was built for;
* `Φ.add_le'` then splits the right-hand side.

**Where Schatten needs finite Minkowski to split, a general symmetric gauge needs
only its own subadditivity** — which is the one place the general argument is
*simpler* than the `ℓᵖ` one, and worth knowing before anyone reaches for a
Minkowski analogue that does not exist here.

The remaining work is the `ℝ≥0∞` bookkeeping: `extend` caps at `m` before
converting, so the weak-majorization hypothesis has to be established for the
capped truncations rather than for `a` itself.

The `ENNReal.ofReal` convention is `schattenENorm`'s, deliberately, so that the
two gauges read the same way.

/-- **Ideal law 4 of 5: subadditivity.**

This is Milestone B2, and it is the only law that is not a pointwise statement
about approximation numbers.  `aₙ(S+T) ≤ aₙ(S) + aₙ(T)` is **false** in general;
what is true is the prefix statement — the Ky Fan inequality — and getting from
prefix sums to a symmetric gauge is weak majorization.

The route is `Family/Schatten.lean`'s, at a general gauge instead of `ℓᵖ`: apply
the `Fin k` theory to the truncation at each `k`.  **Where Schatten needs finite
Minkowski to split the right-hand side, here `toFinite k` is a
`FiniteSymmetricGauge` and its own `add_le` does it.** -/

/-- **Milestone B1, the direction of the Calkin correspondence claimed here.**

Two symmetric gauges inducing the same operator ideal agree on antitone
sequences, so the ideal really is a function of the singular-value sequence
alone.

**The proof is a realisation argument, and it splits on boundedness — which the
roadmap's statement does not show.**  An unbounded antitone sequence is realised
by *no* bounded operator, so the realisation route simply does not apply to it.
It does not have to: `le_extend` makes both sides `∞`, and the equation holds
because neither gauge can see past the supremum.  A bounded sequence is realised
by `diagOpLp`, and `approximationNumber_diagOpLp` is what turns the operator
equality into the sequence equality.

Surjectivity — that every symmetric ideal arises this way — is *not* claimed; it
is the substantial half of Calkin's theorem and needs a separability hypothesis
nothing else here needs. -/

/-- **`S_∞`**, the top of the Schatten scale, defined as the operator-norm family.

The roadmap asks for a separately named endpoint whose gauge is `Φ_∞ = ‖·‖_∞`, and for the
identification with the operator-norm family.  Taking the operator-norm family as the
*definition* keeps this free of the `HasMinMaxLowerBoundEverywhere` hypothesis that
`symmetricGaugeFamily` carries — the roadmap's signature has no such hypothesis — and puts
the content in `gauge_schattenFamilyInf`, which is the `Φ_∞` description. -/

    OperatorIdealFamily.{u₀, v₀, w₀} 𝕜 :=
  operatorNormIdealFamily 𝕜

/-- The `∞` endpoint's gauge is the sup gauge of the approximation-number sequence:
`supGauge_extend_of_antitone` collapses the supremum to `a₀`, which is the operator norm. -/
