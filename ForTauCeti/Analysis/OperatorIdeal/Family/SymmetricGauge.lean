# The operator ideal family induced by a symmetric gauge

Calkin's correspondence in the direction this development needs: a symmetric
gauge on sequences induces an operator ideal family, by applying the gauge to the
sequence of approximation numbers.

* `TauCeti.symmetricGaugeFamily` — the family, `gauge A = Φ∞ (a(A))`.

## The four laws, and where each comes from

Each structure field is one approximation-number fact composed with one law of
`SymmetricGauge.extend`; no new analysis happens here.

* `gauge_add_le` — `ContinuousLinearMap.kyFanGauge_add_le` says the prefix sums
  of `a(A + B)` are dominated by those of `a(A) + a(B)`, which
  `SymmetricGauge.extend_le_extend_of_forall_sum_le` converts into a statement
  about the gauge, and `SymmetricGauge.extend_add_le` then splits the right-hand
  side.  **This is the only field needing two gauge laws**, and it is why
  `extend_add_le` had to exist before this file could;
* `gauge_smul` — `approximationNumber_smul` then `SymmetricGauge.extend_smul`;
* `enorm_le_gauge` — `approximationNumber_index_zero` (`a₀ T = ‖T‖`) then
  `SymmetricGauge.le_extend` at index `0`;
* `gauge_comp_le` — `approximationNumber_comp_le_mul_norm` and its companion,
  then `SymmetricGauge.extend_mono` and `SymmetricGauge.extend_smul`.

## Why `ℂ`

`ContinuousLinearMap.kyFanGauge_add_le` is unconditional over `ℂ`.  Its
`RCLike`-generic counterpart carries a `HasMinMaxLowerBoundEverywhere` typeclass,
so a general-field version of this construction would have to carry it too.  The
roadmap states the family over `ℂ`, and this is the reason.

/-- **Milestone B1, the direction of the Calkin correspondence claimed here.**

Two symmetric gauges inducing the same operator ideal agree on antitone sequences, so the
ideal really is a function of the singular-value sequence alone.

**The proof splits on boundedness, which the roadmap's statement does not show.**  An
unbounded antitone sequence is realised by *no* bounded operator, so the realisation route
does not apply to it — and does not have to: `le_extend` makes both sides `∞`, and the
equation holds because neither gauge can see past the supremum.  A bounded sequence is
realised by `diagOpLp`, and `approximationNumber_diagOpLp` turns the operator equality into
the sequence equality.

Surjectivity — that every symmetric ideal arises this way — is **not** claimed; it is the
substantial half of Calkin's theorem and needs a separability hypothesis nothing else here
needs. -/

/-! ## The adjoint-closed form, and Ky Fan dominance

`IsKyFanDominant` is a class on `SymmetricOperatorIdealFamily`, not on
`OperatorIdealFamily`, so the dominance statement needs the adjoint-closed form
of the construction.  That form differs in exactly one field, `gauge_adjoint`,
which `ContinuousLinearMap.approximationNumber_adjoint` supplies outright: `T`
and `T⋆` have the same approximation numbers, hence the same gauge.

The universes collapse here — `SymmetricOperatorIdealFamily.{u, v}` uses one
universe for source and target — because the adjoint exchanges them.  So this is
the *square* companion of `symmetricGaugeFamily` rather than a replacement.
