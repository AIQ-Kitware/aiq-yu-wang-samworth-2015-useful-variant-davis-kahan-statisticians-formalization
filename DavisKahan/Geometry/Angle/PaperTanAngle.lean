# The literal ambient `tan Θ` of Davis--Kahan

`DavisKahan/Geometry/Angle/PaperOperatorAngle.lean` builds the paper's literal
Hermitian angle `Θ = arcsin |P_U - P_V|` between two closed subspaces and its
sine and cosine.  This module adds the tangent, which is the object the second
conclusion of the Section 2 `tan θ` theorem is about.

The tangent is only an honest `tan` where the angle stays away from `π / 2`.
Mathlib's `Real.tan` is total, with `Real.tan (π / 2) = 0`, so `cfc Real.tan Θ`
is always defined; but the identity `cos Θ · tan Θ = sin Θ` — which is what
makes it *the tangent* — needs uniform transversality of the two subspaces, in
the form `‖sin Θ‖ < 1`.  That hypothesis is exactly what the tangent theorem's
right-hand side supplies when it is finite, so it is not a restriction of the
theory but a statement of where the theory lives.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DavisKahanExt.paperTanAngleOperatorC`: the literal `tan Θ`.
* `TauCeti.DavisKahanExt.paperTanAngleOperatorC_nonneg`.
* `TauCeti.DavisKahanExt.paperCos_mul_paperTan`: `cos Θ · tan Θ = sin Θ` under
  uniform transversality.
* `TauCeti.DavisKahanExt.paperTanTwoAngleOperatorC`: the literal ambient
  `tan 2Θ`, the object of the second conclusion of the Section 2 `tan 2θ`
  theorem.
* `TauCeti.DavisKahanExt.spectrum_paperAngleOperatorC_lt_pi_div_four` and
  `TauCeti.DavisKahanExt.paperTanTwoAngleOperatorC_nonneg`: under uniform
  *quarter* transversality the doubled angle stays inside the principal branch.
* `TauCeti.DavisKahanExt.paperAbsTanTwoAngleOperatorC`: the **branch-free**
  ambient `|tan 2Θ|`, which is nonnegative with no hypothesis at all and agrees
  with `paperTanTwoAngleOperatorC` on the quarter-acute branch.  A unitarily
  invariant norm sees a self-adjoint operator through its singular values, so
  the two carry the same source conclusion.

## Where the estimates about these objects live

The whole-space `tan Θ` estimate `δ ‖tan Θ‖ ≤ ‖H‖` (Section 2, second
conclusion of the `tan θ` theorem; derived at Section 7 lines around equation
(7.6)) is proved in
`DavisKahan/Sources/DavisKahan1970/TanThetaWholeSpace.lean`, and the ambient
`tan 2Θ` estimate in
`DavisKahan/Sources/DavisKahan1970/TanTwoThetaWholeSpace.lean`.  The real-scalar
forms of both, and the real counterparts of the operators defined here, are in
`DavisKahan/Geometry/Angle/PaperOperatorAngleReal.lean` and
`DavisKahan/Sources/DavisKahan1970/WholeSpaceReal.lean`.

/-- The paper's ambient `|tan 2Θ|`, obtained by applying `t ↦ |tan (2 t)|` to
the Hermitian operator angle.

This is the *branch-free* ambient double-angle tangent.  A unitarily invariant
norm sees an operator only through its singular values, so for the self-adjoint
`tan 2Θ` it sees `|tan 2Θ|`; the two objects therefore carry the same source
conclusion.  They differ exactly when some principal angle exceeds `π/4`, where
`tan 2θ` turns negative — which is precisely the situation the quarter-acute
branch excludes and the printed theorem does not. -/
