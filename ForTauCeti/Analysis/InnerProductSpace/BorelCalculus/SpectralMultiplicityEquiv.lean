# Spectral multiplicity data as a complete unitary invariant

`TauCeti.MultiplicityDatum 𝕜` presents an operator as multiplication by the spectral coordinate
on `L²` of a finite base measure on `ℂ` together with an antitone family of measurable level
sets.  This module turns that presentation into a **relation between operators** and proves that,
over `ℂ`, the relation is exactly unitary equivalence.

* `TauCeti.SameSpectralMultiplicity` says that two operators admit multiplicity data whose base
  measures lie in the same measure class and whose level sets agree up to null sets.  It is
  stated over an arbitrary `RCLike` scalar field: the spectral parameter and the base measure
  stay complex, and only the `L²` fibres and the model operator use `𝕜`.
* `TauCeti.sameSpectralMultiplicity_iff_operatorUnitaryEquiv` is the complex classification:
  two bounded self-adjoint operators on complex Hilbert spaces, the first separable, have the
  same multiplicity data if and only if they are unitarily equivalent.

## What the relation is, and is not

It is an existential over **presentations**, and that is what makes the classification provable
without a uniqueness theorem for the multiplicity decomposition.  It is **not** a canonical
invariant: nothing here says the datum of an operator is unique.

The cardinal-valued multiplicity function is encoded by its super-level sets: `level k` is
`{z | k < m z}`, so a point of `level k \ level (k + 1)` has multiplicity exactly `k + 1` and a
point of every `level k` has multiplicity `ℵ₀`.  The encoding is not a proxy --
`TauCeti.MultiplicityDatum.multiplicity` is the honest `ℂ → ℕ∞` multiplicity function,
`TauCeti.MultiplicityDatum.mem_level_iff` proves `level k = {z | k < multiplicity z}`, and
`TauCeti.MultiplicityDatum.measurable_multiplicity` proves it measurable.  Level sets are carried
in the structure only because that makes every hypothesis a plain `MeasurableSet`.

## Scope of the classification

Both classification theorems below stay at `𝕜 = ℂ`, for different reasons.

* The direction from multiplicity data to unitary equivalence rests on
  `TauCeti.operatorUnitaryEquiv_of_measureEquiv`, whose Radon--Nikodym unitary is complex.
* The converse rests on `TauCeti.BorelCalculus.exists_hasMultiplicityModel`, complex
  Hahn--Hellinger, and that is where separability of the first space is spent: a model is built
  from a *countable* cyclic decomposition, and countability of the index is what lets the
  level-set normalisation run, since ranks count earlier indices.  A non-separable statement
  would need the uniform-multiplicity form indexed by cardinals, whose measures are not
  σ-finite.

The real analogues of both directions exist and are proved downstream, against
`TauCeti.operatorUnitaryEquiv_of_measureEquiv_real` and the real Hahn--Hellinger existence
theorem; only the *definition* above is shared, and it is already field-generic.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.SameSpectralMultiplicity`: the relation.
* `TauCeti.operatorUnitaryEquiv_of_sameSpectralMultiplicity`: same data implies unitary
  equivalence, with no separability hypothesis on either space.
* `TauCeti.sameSpectralMultiplicity_of_operatorUnitaryEquiv`: unitary equivalence implies the
  same data, for a self-adjoint operator on a separable space.
* `TauCeti.sameSpectralMultiplicity_iff_operatorUnitaryEquiv`: the classification.

/-- **Equality of spectral multiplicity data over an arbitrary `RCLike` scalar field.**

Two operators have the same spectral multiplicity when each is unitarily equivalent to the
multiplication model of a `TauCeti.MultiplicityDatum 𝕜` -- a finite measure on `ℂ` together with
an **antitone** sequence of measurable level sets -- and the two data agree: the base measures
are in the same **measure class**, and the level sets agree up to null sets.  The spectral
parameter and base measure remain complex; only the `L²` fibres and model operator use `𝕜`.

The measure class is `TauCeti.MeasureEquiv`, a named relation proved to be an `Equivalence` at
the point of definition so that the quotient can be formed later.

This is an existential over *presentations*, and it is what makes
`TauCeti.sameSpectralMultiplicity_iff_operatorUnitaryEquiv` provable.  It is **not** a canonical
invariant: nothing here says the datum of an operator is unique. -/

/-- **Same multiplicity data implies unitary equivalence**, with no separability hypothesis on
either space.

Chain the two models: `A ≃ D.operator ≃ E.operator ≃ B`.  The statement remains at the complex
specialization because the middle step `TauCeti.operatorUnitaryEquiv_of_measureEquiv` uses the
complex `rnDerivL2Equiv` API; the real analogue is proved separately from
`TauCeti.operatorUnitaryEquiv_of_measureEquiv_real`. -/

/-- **Unitary equivalence implies the same multiplicity data.**

This is the direction that needs the existence half of Hahn--Hellinger, and therefore the
separability of `H₁`: a model for `A` is built from a *countable* cyclic decomposition, and
countability of the index is what lets the level-set normalisation run, since ranks count
earlier indices.  `H₂` needs nothing -- `B` inherits `A`'s model along the given unitary, so the
same datum serves for both. -/

/-- **Spectral multiplicity data classify bounded self-adjoint operators on a separable complex
Hilbert space up to unitary equivalence.**

Separability is carried on `H₁` only, and is needed for `→` alone; see
`TauCeti.operatorUnitaryEquiv_of_sameSpectralMultiplicity` for the separability-free converse.
Self-adjointness of `B` is not needed: it follows from that of `A` along the unitary, and in the
`←` direction it is not used at all. -/
