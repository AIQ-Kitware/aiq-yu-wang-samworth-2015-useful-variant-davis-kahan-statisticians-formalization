# Bounded operator absolute value and polar factor — bridge names

This module exposes the bounded polar decomposition under the `spectra*` bridge
names used across the Davis--Kahan operator-angle and direct-rotation programs.

The names date from a complex-only era; the statements below are over an
arbitrary `RCLike` field, carrying the functional-calculus hypothesis of
`ForTauCeti`'s modulus API, which typeclass inference discharges at `𝕜 = ℂ` and
at `𝕜 = ℝ` alike.

## Provenance — this is no longer Spectra-backed

Originally these were thin aliases for `Spectra.QuantumMechanics.Channels.absOp`
and `.polarIsometry`, and the module imported
`Spectra.QuantumMechanics.Channels.PolarDecomp`.  `ForTauCeti` since grew its own
bounded polar decomposition — `ContinuousLinearMap.modulus` and
`ContinuousLinearMap.polarPartial`, more general than Spectra's (rectangular
rather than square) — and this module already carried the two bridge theorems
proving the constructions *equal*: `spectraOperatorAbsoluteValue = T.modulus`
and `spectraPolarIsometry = T.polarPartial`.

Phase S1 of `dev/tauceti/spectra-removal-plan.md` takes the obvious next step:
the definitions now *are* the `ForTauCeti` ones, so those two bridge theorems
collapse to `rfl` and the Spectra import is gone.  Cluster C of the port surface
(`absOp`, `polarIsometry`, `polarRange`) is closed by this file.

Nothing downstream changes: every `spectra*` name keeps its statement, so the
~400 call sites across `Geometry/Polar/**`, `SpectralTheory/**` and
`Experimental/**` are untouched.  The names are now misnomers — there is no
Spectra behind them — but renaming them is a naming-audit sweep over ten
modules, deliberately *not* folded into the dependency removal.  It is recorded
as a follow-on in the removal plan.

Two theorems were deleted rather than kept, because they mentioned Spectra
constants and nothing outside this file used them: `spectra_absOp_eq_modulus`
and `spectra_polarRange_eq_polarInitial`.  `spectraOperatorAbsoluteValue_eq_modulus`
and `spectraPolarIsometry_eq_polarPartial` survive as `rfl`, since
`Geometry/Polar/Section3Nonacute.lean` rewrites with the latter.
